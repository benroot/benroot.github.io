About Ben

I worked as a software developer for 12 years before transitioning a career in medicine as a physician. The thing that grabs me about being a physician is being able to have deep scientific expertise, yet I get to work one-on-one with lay people and help them understand their health. It is about helping someone heal aand achieve their goals that is inspiring me to embark on this new path. 

Also, I get to teach and learn in this field for the rest of my career! Doctors often become teachers in many differnt ways -- Teaching patients about their bodies and health and treatments, teaching medical students who rotate through, and even teaching other doctors and sharing information in the form of research or conferences. We also need to learn all the time.

It is in the spiriti fo teaching and learning, and to inspire myself and others that I created this site to practice conveying complex informaion via words and interactive media. This gives me a place to store some thoughts and share them with others, because otherwise what is the point!

I have been inspired by the [Explorables Movement](http://explorabl.es). It is a group of educators and thinkers who make some awesome interactive learning artifacts. As healthcare and technology become more complicated we need these as a way to come to shared understandings.
